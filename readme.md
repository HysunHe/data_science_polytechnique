# Data Scicence Introduction - École polytechnique

Presentation
--

Here some of the lab assignements and slides from my data science course at the [Ecole polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/). Code and datasets are too heavy to store here, but assignments + slides have presentations of the techniques. 

Their point is not to get into the details, rather broadly mention various machine learning and data science techniques.
